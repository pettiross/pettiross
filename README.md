## What's cooking in my IDE

I'm writing a React (soon React Native) app that's part of an unpublished tabletop board game tentatively titled Wood and Steel. It's a good chance to implement 
a little graph query engine and update my declarative app skills.

I recently spent a lot of coding time writing and updating [Wherobots's example notebooks](https://github.com/wherobots/wherobots-examples)
for geospatial analytics.

## I partner with Product and Engineering on deep technical challenges.

I believe designers can do their best work when they understand the business and the technology that powers it. I've shipped cool 
stuff using full-stack knowledge of ML/AI, hardware/software integration, and coding frameworks at Microsoft, Tableau, three startups,
and as a consultant. I've git some examples in [my portfolio](https://www.portfolio.pettiross.com/). 

GitHub-wise, I don't have a lot of publicly available code, but I did design the 
[Observable 10 color scheme](https://www.portfolio.pettiross.com/observable-10) built into 
[D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and Observable [Plot](https://github.com/observablehq/plot).

## I'm a design leader who builds happy and diverse teams.

I'm a solo product designer now. My most recent professional experience was bringing planetary-scale analytics and AI to life at [Wherobots](https://whereobots.com/). Previously, I 
took the [Tableau](https://tableau.com/) Product Design team from four people in a single office to a team of 40 working in a 1,000+ 
person product org across four time zones. We got to help Tableau go through hypergrowth, have an IPO, and build to $1 billion 
in revenue.
