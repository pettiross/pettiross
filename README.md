## I'm a design leader who builds happy and diverse teams.

I took the [Tableau](https://tableau.com/) Product Design team from four people in a single office to a team of 40 working in a 1,000+ person product org across four
time zones. We got to help Tableau go through hypergrowth, have an IPO, and build to $1 billion in revenue. 

## I help product designers be successful partners with PMs and engineers.

I believe designers can do their best work when they understand the business and the technology that powers it. I've shipped cool 
stuff using full-stack knowledge of ML/AI, hardware/software integration, and coding frameworks at Microsoft, Tableau, three startups,
and as a consultant. I've git some examples in [my portfolio](https://www.portfolio.pettiross.com/). 

GitHub wise, I don't have a lot of publicly available code, but I did design the 
[Observable 10 color scheme](https://www.portfolio.pettiross.com/observable-10) built into 
[D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) and Observable [Plot](https://github.com/observablehq/plot).

## What's cooking in my IDE

I'm co-writing the React Native app that's part of a tabletop board game. It's giving me a good chance to dust off my JavsScript, implement 
a little graph query engine, and update my declarative app skills.
